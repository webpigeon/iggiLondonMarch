# Goldsmiths Module - Assessment 2
This is my AI for our hunter/pray demo. Code in this repo uses the ai-tools library that myself and piers have written. This is a replacement for my cows which are present in that repo. This is in an attempt to make marking easier.

## Running the code
First, you will need to have installed the ai-tools library, as we only started work on it last (2015-03-02) week it's not in maven central. That means you will need to do the following:
* clone ai tools
* cd into the ai tools directory
* run maven install

You can then clone and run code from this repo, as maven will be able to find the ai-tools library.
