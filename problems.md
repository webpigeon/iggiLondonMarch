Problems and what I need to do about them to fix them. This exists to help me write the report.

## Cow Behavours
* Cows behave very predictibly and will all follow the same path -> behavour tree contains no differences per cow or any randomness.
* Cows always eat even when not hungry -> utility actions will solve this, needs to be implemented into behavour tree
* Cows need more behavours to look realistic -> add more behavours
* Cows overeat the grass until it's all dead and they die -> need to be careful not to eat too much grass
* Cow reproduction needs to be implemented
* When adding hearding behavour, plants grow out of control

## Plant behavours
* Plants can overwhelm the screen

## General stuff
* my spelling is really bad, I'll fix it before submission. It's a waste of time to keep stopping work to fix spelling errors.
